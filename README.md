### Spring Stream Backend
The Spring Stream Backend is a lightweight application designed to demonstrate video streaming capabilities within a web application context. Built using Java and Spring Boot, this backend service facilitates seamless video content delivery to frontend clients, making it an ideal foundation for projects requiring media streaming functionalities.

### Overview
This project showcases how to implement video streaming in a web application using Spring Boot. It serves video files over HTTP, allowing clients to stream content efficiently. The backend is structured to handle byte-range requests, enabling features like pause, resume, and seek during video playback.

### Technologies Used
Java: Primary programming language for backend development.

Spring Boot: Framework for building the RESTful API and handling server-side operations.

Maven: Build automation and dependency management.

Spring MVC: For creating REST endpoints and handling HTTP requests.

JavaScript: Used in the frontend for handling video playback (in the associated frontend project).

HTML/CSS: Frontend technologies for structuring and styling the video player interface.
